task:
- fork https://github.com/dglittle/nodesk
- run locally (see readme)
- login
- click "set team" and set a team
- click "post"
- post a test job, unclicking "public" to make it private
- click "list"
- you should see the job you posted
- we want to see a number to the right of that showing how many applicants there are for the job
- put the number in square brackets, like this: [5]
- note: you'll probably be adding code after the line "_.each(o.jobs, function (job) {"
    - and you'll want to access "job.num_candidates"

- test this (should see a 0)
- take a screenshot
- create humanscript directory, if there isn't one
- put screenshot in there
- copy-paste these instructions into a new file in there
- commit everything
- submit pull request to original repository
